# Fundify – Intern Fundraising Portal (Frontend Prototype)

**Fundify** is a responsive, interactive fundraising dashboard designed as part of the **Full Stack Developer Internship - Round 1 Task**.  
It allows interns to track their referral code, view total donations, access rewards, and see where they rank all in a sleek, user-friendly layout.

**Live Site:** [Fundify](https://fundify-five.vercel.app/)

## Firebase Integration (Future Work)
I explored adding:

- Google Authentication using Firebase Auth

- Real time database to store user data and donations

- These features are not part of the current build, but can be integrated in future versions as the backend is developed.

## NOTE
- This is a frontend-only prototype

- All data is static/dummy

- No backend or database integration in this version
